Global Game Jam 2013 Project

This project was created by myself, Jas Mitharu and Michael Biley at the University of Bedfordshire Global Game Jam in January 2013.

We all came from a background of having used C++ and OpenGL and as with all jams, developed the game over a 48 hour period of in a weekend.

Although Unity was getting quite popular by this point, we all had decided we wanted to do something in C++ with old-school OpenGL as a challenge. Unity's 2D tools weren't out at this point, otherwise we would have gone down that route.

As with the 2010 game, it currently uses the devil's libraries of GLAUX and GLUT. It gets a bit trippy at times and can crash.
