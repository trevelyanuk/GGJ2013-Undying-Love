Global Game Jam 2013 Project

This project was created by myself, Jas Mitharu and Michael Biley at the University of Bedfordshire Global Game Jam in January 2013.

We all came from a background of having used C++ and OpenGL and as with all jams, developed the game over a 48 hour period of in a weekend.

Although Unity was getting quite popular at this point, we all had decided we wanted to do something in C++ and OpenGL as a challenge. Unity's 2D tools weren't out at this point, otherwise we may have decided otherwise...

As with the 2010 game, it uses GLAUX and GLUT. It gets a bit trippy at times and can crash. This is really just a reference project for now..
